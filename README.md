The database we are going to study are wave-forms generated by a program written in C. 
There are 5000 instances in the database and includes 3 classes of wave-forms. 
We will therefore try to predict the shape of a wave as well as possible with KNN.

The KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) algorithm is a classification algorithm that works by comparing an example to be classified 
to the examples in the training set. It assigns to the example to be classified with the class that is predominantly represented 
among the K closest examples.

Our study consists on improving the performance of our model in terms of accuracy andtemporal complexity, 
whether with balanced or unbalanced data. For this we will start to see how to choose a wise k thanks to K-fold cross-validation. 
Then the benefits of data cleaning. 

The different algorithms that can accelerate the calculation of the 1-NN. 
And finally the impact of precision on unbalanced data.
